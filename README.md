# PYTHON-FASTAPI-AI-LLAM-POSTGRESSQL-AWS-AI
Intelligent Book Management System with PYTHON, FASTAPI, AI, LLAMA, AWS
üìö Intelligent Book Management System with AI-Powered Summaries & Recommendations üöÄ
Welcome to the Intelligent Book Management System, a modern application built with Python and powered by Llama3 AI for book summaries, PostgreSQL for efficient data management, and Machine Learning for personalized recommendations. Deployed on AWS, this system leverages cutting-edge technology to manage books, reviews, and ratings seamlessly. üìñ‚ú®

üìù Project Description
This system allows users to add, retrieve, update, and delete books. Using the power of AI with Llama3, it generates detailed book summaries and review summaries. Our machine learning model further enhances the experience by recommending books based on user preferences, genre, and ratings.

Everything is exposed via a RESTful API, making it easy to integrate with other systems and providing asynchronous operations for enhanced performance.

‚≠ê Key Features
AI-Powered Summaries: Llama3 generates insightful summaries for books.
Machine Learning Recommendations: Personalized recommendations based on genre and ratings.
RESTful API: Easy-to-use API for interacting with books, reviews, and recommendations.
PostgreSQL Database: Efficient storage of book and review data.
AWS Deployment: Cloud infrastructure for scalability and high availability.
Asynchronous Operations: Optimized for performance with asyncio and asyncpg.

üîó API Documentation
Book Endpoints:
POST /books: Add a new book.
GET /books: Retrieve all books.
GET /books/{id}: Retrieve a specific book.
PUT /books/{id}: Update a book's information.
DELETE /books/{id}: Delete a book.
GET /recommendations: Get book recommendations based on preferences.
Example Code Snippet:
python
Copy code
@app.post("/books/")
async def create_book(book: BookSchema, db: AsyncSession = Depends(get_db)):
    new_book = Book(**book.dict())
    db.add(new_book)
    await db.commit()
    return new_book
This snippet showcases how the app uses FastAPI and asynchronous programming to handle book creation in a PostgreSQL database.

üöÄ AWS Deployment Guide
Set up an AWS account and configure RDS for PostgreSQL.
Deploy the app on EC2 or use AWS Lambda for serverless architecture.
Use S3 for model storage (if necessary).
Set up AWS CloudWatch for monitoring and IAM roles for security.
üß™ Testing
Run unit tests for API endpoints:
bash
Copy code
