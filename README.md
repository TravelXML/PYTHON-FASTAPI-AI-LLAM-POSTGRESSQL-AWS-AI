# üìö Intelligent Book Management System with AI-Powered Summaries & Recommendations üöÄ

Welcome to the **Intelligent Book Management System**, a modern application built with **Python** and powered by **Llama3 AI** for book summaries, **PostgreSQL** for efficient data management, and **Machine Learning** for personalized recommendations. Deployed on **AWS**, this system leverages cutting-edge technology to manage books, reviews, and ratings seamlessly. üìñ‚ú®

## üìù Project Description

This system allows users to **add**, **retrieve**, **update**, and **delete books**. Using the power of AI with **Llama3**, it generates detailed **book summaries** and **review summaries**. Our machine learning model further enhances the experience by recommending books based on **user preferences**, genre, and ratings. 

Everything is exposed via a RESTful API, making it easy to integrate with other systems and providing **asynchronous operations** for enhanced performance.

## ‚≠ê Key Features

- **AI-Powered Summaries**: Llama3 generates insightful summaries for books.
- **Machine Learning Recommendations**: Personalized recommendations based on genre and ratings.
- **RESTful API**: Easy-to-use API for interacting with books, reviews, and recommendations.
- **PostgreSQL Database**: Efficient storage of book and review data.
- **AWS Deployment**: Cloud infrastructure for scalability and high availability.
- **Asynchronous Operations**: Optimized for performance with `asyncio` and `asyncpg`.

### Example Code Snippet:

```python
@app.post("/books/")
async def create_book(book: BookSchema, db: AsyncSession = Depends(get_db)):
    new_book = Book(**book.dict())
    db.add(new_book)
    await db.commit()
    return new_book
```

This snippet showcases how the app uses **FastAPI** and asynchronous programming to handle book creation in a **PostgreSQL** database.

## üöÄ AWS Deployment Guide

1. Set up an AWS account and configure **RDS** for PostgreSQL.
2. Deploy the app on **EC2** or use **AWS Lambda** for serverless architecture.
3. Use **S3** for model storage (if necessary).
4. Set up **AWS CloudWatch** for monitoring and **IAM roles** for security.

## üß™ Testing

- Run unit tests for API endpoints:
  ```bash
  pytest tests/
